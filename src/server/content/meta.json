    "markdown": "# Building a Webhook Between Draft and Google App Engine\n\nI think [Draft](https://draftin.com/) is cool. To describe what Draft is to the\nuninitiated in as few words as possible: It's a minimalist, collaborative,\ncloud-based text editor with [git-like version control\nfeatures](https://draftin.com/images/diff_view2.png).\n\nI haven't had much reason to use Draft.  I write a lot for work but\nunfortunately, for draft's sake and my sanity, everyone in my office is\naddicted to Microsoft Word.  They're also generally distrustful of free web\nservices, regardless of their usefulness.  This is true not just for my office,\nbut [the Federal Government as a whole](http://readwrite.com/2012/05/31/government-market-drags-microsoft-deeper-into-the-cloud#awesm=~obA3HoQ6Kx7h7O).\n\n[Draft's creator](https://twitter.com/natekontny) just announced a webhook\nfeature, so my personal use may be rising.  A webhook gives me the ability to\npublish a blog post with one click from Draft.\n\nIf you don't use a popular blogging service, which is true in my case, a Draft\nwebhook isn't an out-of-the-box type thing.  You have to build it yourself.\nFrankly, I like building software, so this an incentive more so than an\nimpediment.\n\n### In the rest of this post, I'll lay out in detail how I built my webhook.\n\nI have a pretty unusual [blog setup](https://github.com/eblahm/eblahg).  Its\nentirely custom made using Google App Engine platform and the Python API (think\nDjango for Google servers).  I learned to code via App Engine's documentation,\nand hosting a custom blog there seemed to make sense. Casual bloggers would\ndefinitely find my blog setup a pain in the ass.  Most web programmers would\nfind it generally unnecessary, given all the blogging tools already out there\n(Don't worry, someday I'll start using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)).\n\nBut anyways, its what I use.  So for you .00000000000000000000001% like me,\nblogging on App Engine, here's the primary components for building a blog-style\nwebhook between Draft and Google App Engine:\n\n#### 1. a data model that mirrors the [Draft payload](https://draftin.com/documents/69898?token=5fjKKlZ0-AeBzqj_RAftAGdzRzl9VBfBHj5wpSWm_gU)\n\n```python\nfrom google.appengine.ext import db\n\nclass Article(db.Model):\n  title = db.StringProperty()\n  content = db.TextProperty()\n  content_html = db.TextProperty()\n  pub_date = db.DateTimeProperty(auto_now_add=True)\n```\n\n#### 2. a means of generating your secret url \n(Copy and paste url into Draft settings)\n```python\nimport hashlib\nimport webapp2\nfrom google.appengine.ext import db\n\nclass WebHook(db.Model):\n  secret = db.StringProperty()\n\nclass print_secret(webapp2.RequestHandler):\n  def get(self):\n    wh = WebHook.get_by_key_name('draft_webhook')\n    if wh == None:\n      wh = WebHook(key_name='draft_webhook')\n      wh.secret = hashlib.md5(str(wh.key())).hexdigest()\n      wh.put()\n    secret_url = self.request.host_url + \"/publish/\" + wh.secret\n    self.response.out.write(secret_url)\n\napp = webapp2.WSGIApplication([('/print_secret_url', print_secret)])\n```\n\n\n#### 3. a handler to process the Draft payload\n\n```python\nimport webapp2\nimport json\n\nclass draft(webapp2.RequestHandler):\n  def post(self, secret):\n    if secret != WebHook.get_by_key_name(\"draft_webhook\").secret:\n      return self.response.out.write('not authorized')\n\n    data = json.loads(self.request.get('payload'))\n    article = models.Article.get_by_key_name(str(data['id']))\n    if article == None:\n      article = models.Article(key_name=str(data['id']))\n      article.put()\n\n    article.title=d['name']\n    article.content=d['content']\n    article.content_html=d['content_html']\n    article.put()\n    self.response.out.write('published!')\n\napp = webapp2.WSGIApplication([('/publish/(.*)', draft)])\n```\n"
