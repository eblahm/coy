It’s your heart, not the \ndictionary, that gives meaning to your words. A good person produces \ngood deeds and words season after season. An evil person is a blight on \nthe orchard. Let me tell you something: Every one of these careless \nwords is going to come back to haunt you. There will be a time of \nReckoning. Words are powerful; take them seriously. Words can be your \nsalvation. Words can also be your damnation.” \n— Matthew 12:34-37 (MSG)</p>\n</blockquote>\n"
