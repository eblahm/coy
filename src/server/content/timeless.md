# Can a Website be timeless?
Websites are ephemeral in nature.  In physical space, they occupy microscopic magnetic charges on computers.  Those tiny charges can easily lose their integrity (data loss) and the website ceases to exist.  We believe that by duplicating those microscopic charges, that we protect our content against danger.  Is that true?

Works of art, carved in to stone, can be preserved for millenniums.  Do we expect that Amazon's data centers will survive the next 1000 years.  Or perhaps, we'll just keep duplicating and moving our data around, every which way.  That strategy relies quite a bit on the effort of the next generation.  They won't care enough about our data to continue moving and duplicating it. 

I started thinking about the transient nature of digital content after seeing [screenshots from 2002](https://anders.unix.se/2015/10/28/screenshots-from-developers--unix-people-2002/).  Some of these folks spent so much time making their desktops beautiful.  They might as well have built sand castles. 

Maybe beauty in digital form is not meant to be preserved?
