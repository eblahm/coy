> If you do not live in some out-of-the-way place in the world, if you live in a populous city, and you direct your attention outwards, sympathetically engrossing yourself in the people and in what is going on, do you remember each time you throw yourself in this way in the world around you, that in this relation, you relate yourself to yourself as an individual with eternal responsibility? Or do you press yourself into the crowd, where one excuses himself with the others, where at one moment there are, so to speak, many, and where in the next moment, each time, that the talk touches upon responsibility, there is no one? Do you judge like the crowd, in its capacity as a crowd?  You are not obliged to have an option about what you do not understand.  No, on the contrary, you are eternally excused from that.  But you are eternally responsible as an individual to render an account for your opinion, and for your judgement.  And in eternity, you will not be asked inquisitively and professionally, as though by a newspaper reporter, whether there were many that had the same---wrong opinion. You will be asked only whether you have held it, whether you have spoiled your soul by joining in this frivolous and thoughtless judging, because the others, because the many judged thoughtlessly.  
-- Soren Kierkegaard _Purity of Heart - Is to Will One Thing_
