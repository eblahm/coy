> “You have minds like a snake pit! How do you suppose what you say is worth 
anything when you are so foul-minded? It’s your heart, not the 
dictionary, that gives meaning to your words. A good person produces 
good deeds and words season after season. An evil person is a blight on 
the orchard. Let me tell you something: Every one of these careless 
words is going to come back to haunt you. There will be a time of 
Reckoning. Words are powerful; take them seriously. Words can be your 
salvation. Words can also be your damnation.”
