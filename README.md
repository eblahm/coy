#### _Version controlled, database-less blogging with on the fly markdown compilation._

Frameworks like Wordpress and Ghost are great because they manage article creation, update, deletion and publishing via a fancy admin ui.  All the tools for updating the site, come bundled with the site.  However, the features of the admin UI are enabled by a database, which is not version controlled.

Static site generators like Jekyll are great because they use flat files, which are easy to version control.  However, updating content requires editing markdown, yml or json files (in an editor of your choice), compiling those files to html and then updating them to the server.

Why should you choose between an admin ui and performance?  Or between version controlled content and a bundled ui?  I'd like to update my website via its own ui, maintain performance and also version control everything.
