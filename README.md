#### _Version controlled, database-less blogging with on the fly markdown compilation_

Frameworks like Wordpress and Ghost are great because they manage creating, updating, deleting and publishing articles via a fancy admin ui.  All the tools for updating content come bundled.  However, the features of the admin tools are enabled by a database, which is not version controlled.

Static site generators like Jekyll are great because they use flat files, which are easily version controlled.  However, updating content requires editing markdown, yml or json (in an editor of your choice), compiling those files to html and then updating the server.

Why should updating version controlled content be more complex than database driven content?  Why should you have to choose between a bundled ui and version control?  I'd like to have a website that is version controlled but still knows how to update itself.
