#### _Version controlled, database-less blogging with on the fly markdown compilation_

Static site generators like [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)  are great because they use flat files, which are easily version controlled.  However, updating content is a three step process of, editing markdown, yml or json (in an editor of your choice), compiling those files to html and then updating the server.  I find this to be a hassle.  I'd much rather have a admin ui to update the content.

Also, why should updating version controlled content be more complex than database driven content? I'd like to have a website that is version controlled but still knows how to update itself.
